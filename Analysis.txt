Task0: O(1)

Task1: 
    1. I use '|'ï¼Œ union operation => O(n)
    [So result is O(n)]
    
Task2:
    1. a for loop with 'in' operation on a dictionary => O(n) [It is said that 'in' operation for dict use hash mapping]
    2. a sorted function => O(nlogn)
    [So result is: O(nlogn)]
    
Task3:
    1. a for loop with 'in' operation on a set => O(n**2) ['in' for set is O(n)]
    2. a list.sort() => O(nlogn)
    3. a for loop with 'in' operation on a list => O(n**2)
    [So result is: O(n**2)]
    
Task4:
    1. a for loop with 'in' operation on a set => O(n**2)
    2. a difference operation => O(n)
    3. creating a list => O(n)
    4. a list.sort() => O(nlogn)
    [So result is: O(n**2)]
    
# Could you tell me is my analysis is correct? (not only the result)
