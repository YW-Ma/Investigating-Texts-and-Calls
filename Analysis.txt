Task0: O(1)

Task1: 
    1. I use '|'ï¼Œ union operation => O(n)
    [So result is O(n)]
    
Task2:
    1. a for loop with 'in' operation on a dictionary => O(n)
    2. a max() function => O(n)
    [So result is: O(n)]
    
Task3:
    1. a for loop with 'in' operation on a set => O(n)
    2. a list.sort() => O(nlogn)
    3. a for loop with 'in' operation on a list => O(n)
    [So result is: O(n)]
    
Task4:
    1. a for loop with 'in' operation on a set => O(n)
    2. a difference operation => O(n)
    3. creating a list => O(n)
    4. a list.sort() => O(nlogn)
    [So result is: O(n)]

Notice:
If you have "in" with for loop it's just part of the syntax and always takes linear time. [for a in b] O(n)
in-operator with if-clause will take linear time for lists and constant time on average for sets and dictionary. [if a in b] O(n) or O(1)
